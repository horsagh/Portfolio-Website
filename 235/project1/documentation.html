        <h2>Documentation</h2>
        <p>My first step in the design process was to think about my target audience. I have two- for the assignment, my target audience is the professor/TA. However, I hope to use this as an actual portfolio in the future, so I have another target audience- Employers. With that in mind, I went to look at references. I tried to look at them as my target audiences, to imagine what they would see and want in a portfolio. For the professor/TA, what they want is pretty clear, through the assignment description and rubric. I was able to piece together what I thought would make my portfolio appealing to employers. My first thought is that it needs to be fast and easy to navigate. They will be going through dozens of portfolios, so being able to get to the content fast is necessary, or they will leave before seeing what I want them to see. My second thought was that I need to catch their attention. I found that portfolios that were clean, stylized, and had some (but not too many) interactive or moving parts caught my attention the most.

        </p><p>My next step was to work on a color palette. I decided on the light text on a dark background because it’s easier on the eyes. I chose the blue that I did because it conveys professionalism and I like blue. 
            
        </p><p>From there, I went into Google drawings and started making a mock-up. I found that the drop shadows gave a very clean look, so I decided to put them on everything I could. I also decided I wanted a carousel, in order to display my projects in a more interesting manner (this caused some unexpected problems that I’ll explain later). I put my projects at the top of the page that is what employers will be most interested in.

        </p><p>Next, I started working. I decided to use the materialize framework for my carousel, and I used it for the navbar too. I spent a lot of time troubleshooting materialize because I was still pretty new to JS at the time (I’ve learned a lot doing this project). I was just finishing up my site, reading over the assignment one more time to make sure I covered all my bases, when I realized that we weren’t supposed to use any frameworks (Thats why this is being turned in late- I was modifying it not use materialize). On the bright side, now I have a materialize version and a version and one without any frameworks. You can find the materialize version <a href="materialized.html">here</a>.
