    <h1>My Process</h1>
    <p>This project was a large undertaking, and I wish I had more time to develop it. That being said, I used the time I had efficiently and passed a number of challenges along the way. Something that I wish I would've done that I didn't was get pixijs working offline. I pushed every little change to the server in order to test it, which in the long run probably cost me a lot of time that I could've spent fixing bugs and developing more features.<br><br> Part of my process for developing this game was to make sure that my core mechanics were solid before elaborating on them. this meant that it was a lot easier to add features later on, and creating levels was super easy. <br><br>The first aspect I dealt with was visuals- I drew the spritesheets in Photoshop, and while I might've benefitted from spending a little less time on animations, I think that it paid off in the end. The only source I used in this process (other than the PIXIJS documentation) was this article I found on calculating line intersections. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060911055655/http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/geometry/lineline2d/">https://web.archive.org/web/20060911055655/http://local.wasp.uwa.edu.au/~pbourke/geometry/lineline2d/</a></p>
