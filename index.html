          <p>	HACKBOX is a “minigame compilation” mobile game I designed and developed in Unity with another student, funded by a grant from the NSA. Our goal was to create a mobile game that could encourage kids to pursue a career in cybersecurity, to help alleviate the global cybersecurity professional shortage.</p>

        <i>3/2022-Present</i>
        <p>The Trials of Persephone is a first person spellslinger game developed in Unreal Engine 5. It's a personal project that I am developing with the help of a 3D artist. The idea started as a VR game, however in testing I found that the concept didn't play well to VR's strengths, so I remade it in first person.</p>

        <i>4/2022</i>
        <p>D&D Encounter Builder is a web based tool written in JavaScript for planning Dungeons & Dragons. I wrote it on my own using the Open 5e API, in about a week. It allows you to search for monsters with a number of attributes, and then select any number of them to fight your players. It then gives you an approximation for how the fight will turn out.</p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hello! I am a game designer and programmer from Rochester, NY. I specialize in level design and AI and I am passionate about creating immersive, engaging, and memorable gaming experiences!</p>
    <p>As a game designer, I am always looking to invent fresh and unique game mechanics, and I fully embrace the rapid prototyping methodology. I also excel at problem solving, and I’m never afraid to think outside the box when it comes to finding a solution. I believe the best way to make a game is to start with a clear goal and constantly have the player’s psychology in mind.</p>
    <p>Outside of games, I love to stay active with ultimate frisbee, and when it’s too cold for that I love to snowboard. I also have a passion for worldbuilding and writing. </p>
